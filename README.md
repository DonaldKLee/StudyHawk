# StudyHawk
By: Donald Lee
</br><br/>Date: August 4th-7th 2020
<br/><br/> A project inspired by the study timers on [Leading Learners](https://www.leadlearners.ca/study-timer).
<br/><br/> Note: win10toast only works on Window 10 devices, as a result, this program will NOT work for devices not using Windows 10

# About
Note: This is my first ever Python project containing a GUI! Hope you like it! :) <br/>

As most people are working from home or taking online classes due to COVID-19, procrastination can be a huge problem.<br/>

Introducing StudyHawk, a productivity timer that reminds you with notifications on when it is time for your break and when your break ends. <br/>
Additionally, halfway through your productivity session, you will receive a friendly notification reminding you that you should not be procrastinating, just in case if you are. When your break is about 75% over, you will also receive a friendly notification informing you that your break is almost over.
